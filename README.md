# Templates for the Community Apps on the Unraid Operating System

The templates here are develped for the Unraid operatin system. They are free of charge, and free to us. 

The aim with this repo is to bring useful open-source projects into the Unraid eco-system.

I am a delighted Unraid user, and am creating such templates anyways for myself. So, why not gneralizing them, and sharing them with everyone else?
