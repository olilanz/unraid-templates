# Templates for the Community Apps on the Unraid Operating System

The templates here are develped for the Unraid operating system. They are free of charge, and free to use. 

The aim with this repo is to bring useful open-source projects into the Unraid eco-system.

I am a delighted Unraid user, and am creating such templates anyways for myself. So, why not gneralizing and sharing them with everyone else?
